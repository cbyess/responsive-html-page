    <li>Why beards have function purposes on the open sea.</li>

    <header>Pirate Ship Protocol</header>
    <p>Today we'll discuss proper pirate ship protocol. What is it? I've no idea. I've never been on a pirate ship. Cool pirates went extinct, what, like 500 years ago? Way too long, man. That said, so general rules are still to be expected, such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Don't puke where you sleep.</li>
    <li>Don't stare when someone has to lean off the edge of the boat to do their business.</li>
    <li>Don't shout 'land ho' as a joke. It's deceiving.</li>
  </ul></p>
    <p>Beyond the above, it's best to take a bath at least once a month, just for principle if nothing else.</p>

    <header>Duel Etiquette</header>
    <p>Ahh duels, the old way of settling scores or just stabbing someone that beat you in a card game. The rules are thus:
    <ul>
    <li>Peg legs are legal.</li>
    <li>You must be drunk to duel.</li>
    <li>A cheering crowd of pirates must surround you.</li>
  </ul></p>
    <p>Attempt to settle your problems by drawing first blood, not killing one another. If you fail, changes are there won't be enough pirates to run the ship.</p>
